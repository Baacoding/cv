    <h3>A little more about me...</h3>

    <p>I have always felt that your life experiences shape you and the way that you handle situations. 
        Coming from a background in business, majoring at university in business and human resources, I have seen how important it is for teams to work synergistically. 
        In work situations, I have found that a positive work environment has a direct correlation to productivity and achievement of organisational goals. The following is a 
        little more about me so you can see what kind of a team-fit or organisation-fit I might be.
    </p>
    <h4>Team Work</h4>
    <p>
        In Japan team work is everything. Constantly communicating with each other to make sure everyone is on the same page and equally accountable as opposed to the western idea where 
        everyone is in it for themselves. I believe a balance between these two stances are required. Having a team that is open and supportive to each other, while still have a 'tanto' 
        or person responsible for the project or parts of a project creates the best kind of atmosphere. Giving a small amount of ownership or responsibility to team member creates a great sense of pride and achievement, 
        all while continuing a positive work and team atmosphere. Keeping everyone in the loop, with open communication is vital to fostering this kind of positive team environment.

    <h4>Continued Learning and Development</h4>
    <p>I was initially working as an English Communications professor at a Japanese University in Kanagawa prefecture when I decided to break away and begin a career in IT.
        I felt llike I had reached my peak in my career. IT is constantly changing and there are always new skills to learn. I love
        being able to learn from others and watching myself grow. Even when supporting clients with simple requirements, there is always something you can do to keep you motivated.
        I found that learning to write simple batch scripts to automate processes greatly helped me when I was in such a postion. 
    </p>

    <h4>Planning and Delegation</h4>
    <p>If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Planning is so important to the execution of any project, no matter how big or small. Creating pkans for how you want things to go, and how
        you should handle things IF things go wrong is equally importnant.
